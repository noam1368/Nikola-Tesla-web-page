            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-me">Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the development of alternating current (AC) electrical systems. <br />
                <h3><b>Early Life</b></h3>
                <p><strong>Birth</strong>: Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, part of modern-day Croatia.</p>
                <p><strong>Education</strong>: He studied engineering and physics in the 1870s at the Technical University of Graz and later at the University of Prague, although he did not complete a degree.</p>

                <h3>Career and Major Contributions</h3>
                <p><strong>Move to the United States</strong>: Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, where he initially worked with Thomas Edison. However, their differing approaches to electrical power led to a professional split.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternating Current (AC)</strong>: Tesla is most famous for his work on AC power systems, which allowed for the efficient transmission of electricity over long distances, unlike Edison's direct current (DC) systems. His inventions in this field included the AC induction motor and transformer, which were pivotal in the widespread adoption of AC power.</p>
                <p><strong>Inventions and Patents</strong>: Tesla held around 300 patents for his inventions. Some notable inventions include the Tesla coil, which is used in radio technology and wireless transmission of energy. He also developed early X-ray imaging, radio waves (though Guglielmo Marconi is often credited with inventing the radio), remote control, and neon lighting.</p>
                <p><strong>Experiments and Theories</strong>: Tesla conducted various high-profile experiments, including attempts to create wireless energy transmission. His Wardenclyffe Tower was an ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to achieve this. He theorized about advanced concepts like robotics, radar, and computer science long before they were developed.</p>
                
                <h3>Personal Life and Later Years</h3>
                <p><strong>Personality and Characteristics</strong>: Tesla was known for his eccentric personality and visionary ideas. He was a lifelong bachelor and had a somewhat reclusive lifestyle.</p>
                <p><strong>Later Years</strong>: In his later years, Tesla faced financial difficulties despite his early successes and lived in relative obscurity. He died on January 7, 1943, in New York City.</p>

                <h3>1. List three main differences between Web 1, Web 2, and Web 3:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Content Creation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Web 1:</strong> Developer-created content, static and read-only.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web 2:</strong> User-generated content, dynamic and interactive.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web 3:</strong> Decentralized content, enhanced by blockchain technology, and smart applications.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Web 1:</strong> Minimal interactivity, limited to navigation and reading.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web 2:</strong> High interactivity with social media, forums, and real-time communication.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web 3:</strong> Even higher interactivity, incorporating AI for personalized experiences and decentralized applications (dApps).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Security and Privacy:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Web 1:</strong> Basic security measures, no real privacy controls.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web 2:</strong> Improved security, but centralized control can still lead to privacy issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web 3:</strong> Enhanced security and privacy through blockchain technology, with user control over data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <h3>Consider the search query "effects of physical exercise":</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web 1:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user searches for "effects of physical exercise" and finds static web pages created by developers. These pages might list general information, but there is no way to interact or get updated data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> The information is static and may be outdated, and there is no way to ask questions or get personalized advice.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Web 2:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user searches for "effects of physical exercise" on a search engine. The results include dynamic content from fitness forums, social media posts, and community-driven sites where users discuss their experiences and can ask questions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> The user can interact with the content, ask questions in forums, get real-time feedback, and read up-to-date information shared by other users.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Web 3:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> The user searches for "effects of physical exercise" using a decentralized search engine that leverages blockchain technology. The search results not only include dynamic content but also personalized recommendations based on the user's health profile (with their consent and full privacy).</li>
                            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> The information is highly personalized and secure. The user can interact with AI-driven applications to get tailored advice and even use decentralized health platforms where their data is protected by blockchain, ensuring privacy and trust.</li>
